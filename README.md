Hi there! My name is Kartik and I'm a Computer Science Junior at __BITS Pilani__. I'm an aspiring Software Engineer with an immense passion for Programming. My Programming interests include __Web Development, Machine Learning__ and __GUI Development__.

I'm also passionate about __Open Source__, and find it to be a great way to give back to the Community while picking up on good coding practices in the process.

Apart from programming, I also love playing guitar and drinking coffee
